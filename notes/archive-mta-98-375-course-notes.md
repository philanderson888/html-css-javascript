Critical Terms
Overview
app container - An app container is a separate memory space within a system in which an application runs. An app container prevents corruption of the operating system if the application fails for some reason and enables a user to cleanly uninstall the app.
app package - An app package is a file that contains an app’s files and folders. The purpose of an app package is for ease of distribution and deployment.
AppCache - The Application Cache, or AppCache, is an HTML5 feature that enables Web data to be stored locally when a user is offline. AppCache stores resources like images, HTML pages, CSS files, and JavaScript—data that would ordinarily be stored on a server. Because the resources are stored on the client’s hard disk or device, the resources load faster when requested.
application programming interface (API) - An application programming interface (API) is a list of instructions letting a program communicate with another program.
application state - The application state is the phase of a running application at any point in time. For Web applications, the application state is created when the Web browser sends the first request for a Web page to the Web server, and it ends when the user closes the browser.
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language that defines styles for HTML. CSS styles are usually saved in a separate file from the HTML file. This enables you to easily change fonts, font sizes, and other attributes in the CSS file and the changes are reflected across all HTML files that reference the CSS file.
cookies - Cookies are small files that contain information about the user and the Web site visited and are saved on the user’s computer.
debugging - Debugging is the process of detecting, finding, and correcting logical or syntactical errors in an application.
gesture - A gesture is any finger move, which can involve a single finger (one-touch, such as press, tap, press and hold, slide to pan, and so on) or a finger and a thumb (two-touch, such as a pinch and stretch or a turn to rotate).
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) - Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the language used to describe Web pages. It is a markup language, not a programming language, which means HTML uses markup tags such as <body> and <h1> to describe parts of a Web page.
Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) - Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol that transfers data on the World Wide Web.
HTML5 - HTML5 is the latest HTML standard and a family of technologies that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML5 standard won’t be finalized for a few years.
identity permissions - Identity permissions are sets of characteristics that identify an assembly. Identity permissions protect assemblies (compiled code libraries) based on evidence, or credentials, which is information about the assembly that an assembly must have in order to run.
JavaScript - JavaScript is a scripting language that adds interactivity to Web pages.
launcher icon - A launcher icon is a small image that represents an app.
localStorage - localStorage is a JavaScript method that allows users to save relatively large amounts of data from session to session (persistent data), and there’s no time limit as to how long the data exists.
markup language - A markup language is a set of symbols and rules to describe the parts of a markup document, like an HTML Web page.
media queries - A media query is a CSS3 feature that detects the user’s type of screen and sizes the output accordingly.
Metro-style user interface (UI) - A Metro-style user interface (UI) is the UI used in Microsoft Windows 8. The Metro style UI includes features like a clean, uncluttered look and feel, use of the full screen, large hubs (graphical buttons), and a focus on lateral scrolling.
namespace - A namespace is a sort of work area or abstract container for related objects (pages, code, etc.). A single app package can have a lot of functionality. To keep all of the components separated so they don’t conflict, a package defines a namespace.
permission sets - A permission set is a group of permissions. In coding, transparent code executes commands that don’t exceed the limitations of a permission set.
persistent state information - Persistent state information is data that an application needs after the session ends. Many Web applications need to store data (make it persistent) so that users can pick up where they left off when they return to the site.
platform-independent - The term platform-independent describes an application that can run on different desktop and mobile device operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer, Windows Phone, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, and Blackberry OS.
scripting language - A scripting language is a programming language that uses scripts and requires no compiler.
session state - The session state is an application’s working set of data. When a user first requests access to an application, the session state is created. The state ends when the user closes the session.
sessionStorage - sessionStorage is a JavaScript method that keeps data only for one session (until the browser is closed), which is also referred to as “per-tab storage.”
touch event - A touch event is the action an application takes in response to a gesture.
touch-screen emulator or simulator - A touch-screen emulator or simulator is an application that imitates a system that only has touch capabilities.
validator - A validator is an application that looks for anything that could cause code to be interpreted incorrectly, such as missing or unclosed tags, an improper DOCTYPE declaration, a trailing slash, deprecated code, and so on.
Windows Runtime (WinRT) - The Windows Runtime (WinRT) is an application architecture, or framework, that sits on top of the Windows 8 kernel. Developers test Windows applications and users run Windows 8 apps within WinRT.
Windows Store - The Windows Store is an online global marketplace for Metro-style apps. Publishing your app for distribution through the store can possibly turn a good idea into a lucrative venture.
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main standards body developing specifications for HTML5, CSS3 and other Web technologies.
application packaging: the process of bundling an application and its resources into an archive format for the purpose of distribution and deployment.
platform: the type of computer or operating system being used. The platforms referenced for the content of this review kit are Windows®, Internet Explorer®, and Windows Phone 7.
permissions: the ability of a particular user to access a particular resource by means of his or her user account. Permissions are grouped into permission sets, and every assembly is assigned a set. The .NET Framework defines some standard permission sets, such as FullTrust (implies all permissions) and Execution (permission to only access the CPU).
credentials: the level of access assigned to a user account. Credentials can be set to Windows Authentication, database authentication, no authentication, or custom authentication.
hosting: the practice of providing computer and communication facilities to businesses or individuals, especially for use in creating web and electronic commerce sites. To become active, an application or service must be hosted within a run-time environment that creates it and controls its context and lifetime.
Images, Audio and Video
attribute - An attribute is a modifier of HTML elements that provides additional information.
audio element - The audio element enables you to incorporate audio, such as music and other sounds, in HTML documents.
canvas element - The canvas element is new in HTML5 and creates a container for  graphics, and uses JavaScript to draw the graphics dynamically.
codec - A codec is a technology used for compressing data.
compression - Compression reduces the amount of space needed to store a file, and it reduces the bandwidth needed to transmit the file.
deprecation - Deprecation is the state of an element or attribute that’s been removed from the list of available HTML elements because its functionality is no longer useful.
doctype - The doctype is an instruction, or declaration, found at the very top of almost every HTML document that associates the document with a Document Type Definition (DTD). When a Web browser reads a doctype declaration, the browser assumes that everything on the Web page uses the language or rules specified in the declaration.
element - An element is the combination of tags and the content they enclose. An element can describe content, insert graphics, and create hyperlinks. A tag pair or an empty tag is called an element.
empty tag - An empty tag is a single tag that doesn’t require an end tag, like <br /> for a line break and <hr /> for a horizontal line.
entity - An entity is a special character, such as the dollar symbol, the registered trademark (a capital R within a circle), and accented letters.

figcaption element - The figcaption element adds a caption to an image on a Web page, and you can display the caption before or after the image.
figure element - The figure element specifies the type of figure you’re adding, such as an image, diagram, photo, and so on. This element provides a major benefit: the ability to easily add multiple images side by side.
global attribute - A global attribute is one you can use with any HTML5 element. Examples of global attributes include id, lang, and class, among many others.
nesting - Nesting means to place one element inside another.
raster image - A raster image is an image made up of pixels, such as a photograph. Raster images are most often in JPG format. Other raster file formats that work well on Web pages are PNG, GIF, and BMP.
render - Render means to interpret or reproduce. When a Web browser or mobile device such as a smartphone opens an HTML file, it renders the content of the page.
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) - Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a language for describing 2D graphics in Extensible Markup Language (XML). SVG technology is not new, but HTML5 now enables SVG objects to be embedded in Web pages without using the <object> or <embed> tags.
tags - Tags are keywords that help to give an HTML page structure.
valid - Valid means logically correct. If a Web page adheres to the specifications perfectly, it is considered valid.
vector image - A vector image is an image made up of lines and curves based on mathematical expressions. A vector image is an illustration, such as a line drawing. Developers often convert vector file formats from programs like Adobe Illustrator or CorelDRAW, which aren’t supported by Web browsers, into PNG or GIF for Web display.
video compression - Video compression reduces the size of video images while retaining the highest quality video with the minimum bit rate.
video element - The video element enables you to incorporate videos in HTML documents using minimal code.
codec: a technology used for compressing data. Audio and video codec compress and/or decompress digital audio data into different formats to retain the highest quality with minimum bit rate.
data compression: a means of reducing the amount of space or bandwidth needed to store or transmit a block of data, used in data communications, facsimile transmission, file storage and transfer, and CD-ROM publishing.
semantic: the relationship between words or symbols and their intended meanings. Programming languages are subject to certain semantic rules. A program statement can be syntactically correct but semantically incorrect; a statement can be written in an acceptable form and still convey the wrong meaning.
video compression: reduction of the size of files containing video images stored in digital form. If not compressed, 24-bit color video at 640 x 480 pixels would occupy almost one megabyte per frame, or over a gigabyte per minute.
Input Elements
article element - The article element defines a part of an HTML document that consists of a “self-contained composition” that is independent from the rest of the content in the document.
aside element - The aside element is used to set off content that’s related to the current topic but would interrupt the flow of the document if left inline.
autofocus attribute - The autofocus attribute moves the focus to a particular input field when a Web page loads. An example of autofocus is when you open a search engine Web page and the insertion point automatically appears in the input box so you can type search terms without first clicking in the box.
automatic validation - Automatic validation of input means the browser checks the data the user inputs.
client-side validation - Client-side validation is the process of validating user input before submission to the server. A browser is often used to validate user input locally.
datalist element - The datalist element enables you to present the user with a drop-down list of options to select from. Only the options in the list may be selected.
email attribute - The email attribute requires the user to enter an email address into an input field.
footer element - The footer element defines a footer for a document or section, and typically contains information about the document or section, such as the author name, copyright data, links to related documents, and so on.
form input - Form input is the information a user enters into fields in a Web or client application form.
global attribute - A global attribute can be used with any HTML element; in other words, it’s permitted globally.
header element - The header element defines a header for a document, section, or article.
menu element - The menu element presents a list (or menu) of commands, usually with buttons. The W3C prefers that you use the menu element only for context menus, lists of form controls and commands, toolbars, and similar items.
nav element - The nav element defines a block of navigation links. The nav element is useful for creating a set of navigation links as your document’s primary navigation, a table of contents, breadcrumbs in a footer, or Previous-Home-Next links.
ordered list - A list that orders the list entries using numbers, by default.
pattern attribute - The pattern attribute provides a format (a regular expression) for an input field, which is used to validate whatever is entered into the field.
placeholder text - Placeholder text is text displayed inside an input field when the field is empty.
required attribute - The required attribute requires information in a field when the form is submitted.
section element - The section element defines a section in a document, such as a chapter, parts of a thesis, or parts of a Web page whose content is distinct from each other. The W3C specifies uses for the section element to differentiate it from other structure-related elements, mainly that it contain at least one heading and that it define something that would appear in the document’s outline.
semantic markup - Semantic markup is intuitive markup that gives better meaning or definition to several tags so they make more sense to humans, programs, and Web browsers.
server-side validation - Server-side validation is the process of a server validating data received from a user input form.
table - An HTML table contains rows and columns, and is used to organize and display information in a grid format.
unordered list - A list that displays list entries in a bulleted list.
validation - Validation is the process of verifying that information entered or captured in a form is in the correct format and usable before sending the data to the server.
Web form - A Web form is a Web page that provides input fields for a user to enter data, which is sent to a server for processing. From there, the information is stored in a database or forwarded to a recipient.
CSS Key Terms
absolute positioning - Absolute positioning is the placement of an element at a geometric position in the display, relative to the first parent element that has a non-static position.
block flow - Block flow is a positioning method in which an element is separated from other elements by new lines above and below, and fills from left to right the horizontal extent where it appears.
bounding box - A bounding box is an invisible rectangle, the smallest perimeter of which surrounds a word.
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language that defines styles for HTML. CSS styles are usually saved in a separate file from the HTML file. This enables you to easily change fonts, font sizes, and other attributes in the CSS file and the changes are reflected across all HTML files that reference the CSS file.
class - Class is an attribute a Web author uses to provide structure to a document beyond the meaning HTML builds in with elements such as paragraph, header, and so on.
declaration - The declaration is the style for a specific selector. A declaration has a property, which is a style attribute, and a value.
float positioning - Float positioning is the flexible placement of elements, enabling them to move as far as possible either to the right or left; text then “wraps” around the element.
font - A font is a set of characters of a particular size and style.
font-family property - The font-family property can declare either a specific font, like Garamond or Arial, or a wider family that includes many different fonts, such as “serif.”
hidden overflow - Hidden overflow is a feature that makes overflow invisible.
inline flow - Inline flow is a feature that forces no new lines before or after the inlined element, but simply places the element between the content before and after the inlined element.
monospace - Monospace is a type of font family in which each character is the same width. Monospace is often used for technical material such as formulas, numbers, codes, and so on.
rules - Rules are statements that tell Web browsers how to render particular elements on an HTML page or how to apply CSS styles to Web pages.
sans serif - Sans serif is a font style drawn without serifs, such as the Arial font. Serifs are the details at the ends of particular letters; look at the “d,” “p,” and “t” in this sentence for examples of serif characters.
scrolling overflow - Scrolling overflow is a feature that prevents content that can overflow its box from appearing outside the box. The content appears to be clipped.
selector - A selector is a feature that defines which HTML elements will be affected by CSS code. For example, in CSS, the p selector means a particular style will be applied to paragraphs. The general syntax for a selector is selector {property: value}.
visible overflow - Visible overflow is a feature that enables content that overflows it box to appear in the display rather than be clipped or hidden. Visible overflow also writes over the content that follows it.
CSS Box, Flex and Grid Layouts (Chapter 5)
block-level element - A block-level element creates boxes that contribute to the layout of an HTML document. Sections, articles, paragraphs, lists, and images are examples of block-level elements.
border - A border is a colored or transparent line, which can be thin or thick, that surrounds a box. The border is a part of the CSS Box model.
content - Content is whatever is displayed on a Web page, such as text and images. Regarding the CSS Box model, content is text or images contained within a box. You use the border, margin, padding, height, and width CSS properties to modify various parts of the CSS Box model.
flexbox - A flexbox is a type of layout that enables relative sizes and positioning of boxes. Flexbox takes available space into account when defining box dimensions. A box can include child boxes that are flexible by height and width.
flexbox item - A flexible item is a child box. A child box can be flexible or static. The flex property makes child boxes flexible.
Flexbox Box model - The CSS Flexbox Box model is a layout mode for using flexible boxes in user interfaces.
grid item - A grid item is a child element of a grid.
grid layout - A grid layout is a way to structure complex HTML documents using rows and columns to make the design look cleaner and structured.
Grid Layout model - The CSS Grid Layout model is a model for structuring HTML layouts. This model lets you control the design of sections or entire HTML-based documents using CSS3.
grid template - A grid template, an approach to grid layouts, is like an empty table into which data can be flowed. A grid template uses alphabetical characters to represent the position of items in a grid.
inline element - Inline elements are elements designed for laying out text and don’t disrupt the flow of the document. Applying boldface and the new HTML5 mark element are examples of inline elements.
margin - A margin is the outermost edge of a box, providing space between the box and other boxes in an HTML document. Margins are transparent. The margin is a part of the CSS Box model.
media queries - A media query is a CSS3 feature that detects the user’s type of screen and sizes the output accordingly.
padding - Padding is the space between the border of a box and its content. Padding generally takes on the same color as the box’s background color. Padding is a part of the CSS Box model.
parent/child relationship - The parent/child relationship describes how a parent box can contain one or more child boxes. Boxes contained within a parent box are referred to as child boxes. Child boxes inherit attributes applied to parent boxes unless coded otherwise.
user interface (UI) - A user interface (UI) is the portion of a Web site or application with which a user interacts.
vendor prefix - A vendor prefix is a keyword surrounded by dashes, added to the front of a CSS3 property name. The Microsoft Internet Explorer Web browser recognizes the
-ms- prefix. Vendor prefixes help to ensure CSS3 styles work properly in Web pages during the transition from CSS2 to CSS3.
CSS Exclusions, Regions (Chpater 6)
content container - Using CSS Regions, a content container is an area into which content is flowed.
content source - Using CSS Regions, a content source may be one or more blocks of text in the same or a separate HTML document that holds the content you want to flow through a layout. The content is referred to as a “content stream.”
CSS Exclusions - CSS Exclusions are another name for positioned floats.
CSS Regions - CSS Regions are defined areas (regions) of an HTML document where content can flow. Similar to a page layout program, when there’s too much content to fit in one region, the remaining content automatically flows into the next region.
flow-from - The flow-from property specifies one or more content containers.
flow-into - The flow-into property specifies a content source.
hyphenation - Hyphenation is the process of connecting two words with a hyphen mark (-) or breaking words between syllables at the end of a line.
iframe - Iframes are like mini boxes on a Web page that contain external content embedded in an HTML document, as the content source.
multi-column layout - Multi-column layout lets you create columns, divide text across multiple columns, specify the amount of space that appears between columns (the gap), make vertical lines (rules) appear between columns, and define where columns break. You create a multi-column layout using CSS3 properties.
named flow - A named flow is a set of elements taken from the source and to be flowed into a content container.
positioned float - A positioned float is a CSS construct that enables you to position images, text, and boxes anywhere in an HTML document and then wrap text completely around these elements.
CSS Graphical Effects (Chapter 7)  
animation - An animation is the display of a sequence of static images at a fast enough speed to create the illusion of movement.
border-radius property - The CSS3 border-radius property creates rounded corners around layout elements, like headers, footers, sidebars, graphics boxes, and outlines around images. border-radius is a length, which is usually expressed in pixels or ems but can be a percentage. The length is the radius of the circle that defines the “roundedness” of each box corner
drop shadow - A drop shadow is a visual effect in which an object is repeated behind and slightly below itself to create the illusion that the object floats over its background.
gradient - A gradient is a smooth change of colors, either within the same hue, such as from dark green to light green, or starting with one color and ending with a different color, such as starting with blue and ending with yellow.
keyframe - A keyframe is a construct that enables you to change values anywhere within an animation. You can also pause, resume, and reverse animations.
linear gradient - A linear gradient is a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal gradient.
opacity - Opacity is the quality of an object, like an image or rectangle, that does not allow light to shine through; an opaque image is not transparent.
perspective - Perspective, in terms of drawings and illustrations, is the convergence of lines that give the illusion of depth.
radial gradient - Radial gradients start from a central point and radiate color out to the edges of a container.
rotate - To rotate an element turns it clockwise by a specified number of degrees. To rotate an element, you use the rotate() method in CSS and specify the degrees of rotation.
scale - To scale an element is to increase or decrease its size.
skew - To skew an element is to stretch it in one or more directions. To skew an element using CSS, you use the skew() method and provide x-axis and y-axis values, in degrees, to create an angular shape.
SVG filter - An SVG filter is a set of operations that use CSS to style or otherwise modify an SVG graphic. The enhanced graphic is displayed in a browser while the original graphic is left alone.
transform - In HTML5/CSS3, a transform is an effect that lets you change the size, shape, and position of an element.
transition - A transition is a change from one thing to another; in CSS, a transition is the change in an element from one style to another.
translate - To translate an element means to move it, without rotating, skewing, or otherwise turning the image.
transparency - Transparency is reduced opacity.
Web Open Font Format (WOFF) - The Web Open Font Format (WOFF) allows Web developers to use custom fonts instead of being limited to the standard Web fonts. WOFF files are compressed True Type, OpenType, or Open Font Format fonts that contain additional metadata.
Web safe - Web safe refers to a set of standard fonts that are typically located on a user’s computer and render consistently in the majority of Web browsers.
Javascript (Chapter 8)   
callback - A callback is a response to an event, such as a script execution in response to a mouse click.
computer program - A computer program is a recipe we direct the computer to execute that results in a particular display or action.
dynamic application - A dynamic application is one that adjusts and responds to end particular users or user actions.
event handler - An event handler is an optional script or executable that handles input received in a program. Handlers are JavaScript code inside the <html> tags (rather than the <script> tags) that execute other JavaScript code in response to an event.
events - An event is an action that triggers another action to occur.
function - A function is a segment of a program defined and performed in isolation from other parts.
identifier - An identifier is the name of a variable or function. Identifiers cannot be the same as words already used in the language; for example, “if ” has a special meaning in JavaScript statements and is not available as a variable name.
interactivity - Interactivity enables an end user to take an action in an application, usually by clicking a button or pressing a key.
JavaScript library - A JavaScript library is pre-written JavaScript code.
jQuery - jQuery is the leading JavaScript library.
library - A library is collection of resources, like pre-written function code and subroutines, that developers use to create programs. JavaScript builds in a library of useful functions for many common operations.
methods - Methods are JavaScript functions that belong to objects. Methods differ from functions only in that methods are always associated and used with a particular object.
subroutines - A subroutine is a function that returns no value.
validation - Validation is the process of verifying that information entered or captured is in the correct format.
variable - A variable is a symbolic abbreviation, or name, that stands for a piece of data.
 
Animations, Graphics and Data (Chapter 9)   
animation - An animation is the display of a sequence of static images at a fast enough speed to create the illusion of movement.
AppCache - The Application Cache, or AppCache, is an HTML5 feature that enables Web data to be stored locally when a user is offline. AppCache stores resources like images, HTML pages, CSS files, and JavaScript—data that would ordinarily be stored on a server. Because the resources are stored on the client’s hard disk or device, the resources load faster when requested.
canvas element - The canvas element is a drawing area under programmatic control.
cookies - Cookies are small text files that Web sites save to a computer’s hard disk that contain information about the user and his or her browsing preferences.
data type - A data type is JavaScript’s interpretation of the kind of data a program can work with. Data types include string, number, array, Boolean, null, object, and undefined.
encapsulate - To encapsulate is to group data and the methods that operate on it under a single name.
JSON - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a subset of JavaScript, providing a way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner.
Local Storage - Local Storage is an HTML5 feature that uses the localStorage method to allow users to save relatively large amounts of data from session to session (persistent data). It is an improvement on data storage using cookies.
parsing - Parsing is a term used to describe analysis of complex information into constituent parts.
recursion - Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself.
XMLHttpRequest API - The XMLHttpRequest API, sometimes abbreviated XHR, enables you to use JavaScript to pass data in the form of text strings between a client and a server.
Advanced Features (Chapter 10)  
accelerometer - An accelerometer is a device that measures acceleration, which is a change in speed or direction over a period of time. The Accelerometer sensor detects forces applied to the device, such as movement (up, down, sideways) and gravity.
Blob - A Blob is a data type that can store binary data, like images or multimedia files.
capacitive touch screen - A capacitive touch screen uses electrodes to sense objects touching the screen. Because the object must have conductive properties, a finger works but something like a stylus does not. Most touch-screen smartphones and computer monitors are capacitive.
civic data - Civic data is location data that’s more easily understood by humans, such as a map or an address like 637 Park Street.
device-independent - A program or interface that runs software that produces similar results on a wide variety of hardware is also called device-independent.
File API - The File API allows a browser or application to upload files from local storage to a remote server without the need for a plug-in.
geodetic data - Geodetic data provides raw location data, such as longitude and latitude, or meters.
Geolocation API - The Geolocation API defines an interface that provides a device’s location, usually using latitude and longitude coordinates. The API exposes the latitude and longitude to JavaScript in a Web page using the geolocation object.
gesture event - A gesture event is a type of touch event triggered by a multi-finger gesture. Gesture events receive event objects that contain touch properties.
local storage - Local storage is persistent data and is useful for things like online to-do lists, contact lists, calendars, and saved shopping cart data. You want this information to be available to the user after the browser closes and the user reopens it at some point. The information is held in persistent memory of Web applications and mobile devices.
platform-independent - The term platform-independent describes an application that can run on different desktop and mobile device operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer, Windows Phone, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, and Blackberry OS.
polling - Polling is the process in which a browser contacts a Web server periodically (sometimes constantly) to see if new information is available to present to the user. Technologies such as Comet refresh only a portion of a Web page. Comet and similar “push” technologies introduced polling.
resistive touch screen - A resistive touch screen is made up of several layers, the topmost of which flexes when pressed and pushes into the layer underneath. Sensors detect the pressure, which is how the system knows which part of the screen has been pressed. The touch screens used in hospitals and restaurants are often resistive.
session storage - Session storage is temporary data that’s kept for only one session, until the browser is closed. All of the data in a session is saved in session storage and then erased from session storage when you close the browser tab or window.
touch event - A touch event is the action an application takes in response to a gesture.
touch object - In JavaScript, the touch object detects input from touch-enabled devices.
touchlist - A touchlist references touch objects; the touchlist includes all of the points of contact with a touch screen.
Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) - The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) maintains a living HTML specification that includes APIs that were not originally part of the HTML5 specification. These include Geolocation, Web Workers, WebSockets, and File API.
Web Worker API - Web Workers are APIs that allow scripts to run in the background as parallel threads. These background threads can connect to multiple Web pages, fetch real-time data like stock updates, make network requests, or access local storage while the main HTML document responds to the user input like tapping, scrolling, and typing. Web Workers help keep your user interface responsive for users.
WebSocket API - WebSocket is an API that offers full-duplex communication, which is simultaneous two-way communication, through a single socket over the Internet. Developers use WebSockets mainly for real-time Web applications like chat, multiplayer online gaming, and stock quotes.

Building Apps


  Metro Apps : WINDOWS 8

    WinRT ==> Windows RUNTIME

  Windows 10

    UWP Universal Windows Platform app


      different to .EXE or .MSI

      ==> can't install : have to download via WINDOWS STORE APP


  XAML  ==> BUILDING WITH AN XML INTERFACE



BUILDING AN APP

  MANIFEST FILE

    Name, ORIENTATION, PATH TO ICON

    CAPABILITIES ==> ASK USER PERMISSION TO USE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF DEVICE
        CAN WE USE CAMERA PLEASE?

    

  APPLIATION PACKAGE : FINAL 'ZIP' FILE OF ALL RELEASED FILES IN ONE UNIT

  
  APPLICATION 'CONTAINER' : MEMORY SPACE THAT YOUR APP RUNS IN (SO AS TO NOT CRASH
      OTHER PARTS OF OS IF APP CRASHES)

      ((THINK 'DOCKER'))


      




What is an application?

Building A Windows Store Application in XAML


Host Process
Application Package
Application Container
WinRT called Windows RunTime (in Windows 8) replaced by Windows 10 UWP Universal Windows Platform

Package file
All of the files inside the application, zipped up and made available for distribution
Examples include
Android .apk
IOS .app
Windows .exe  .msi


Application Manifest File
  
  Contains instructions about the capabilities of the application.
  eg Windows Store App : File is called Package.appxmanifest
  
  Basic Template Example At https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211475.aspx
  
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

  <DeviceCapability Name="humaninterfacedevice">
  <DeviceCapability Name="pointOfService"/>


Security

  Permissions grant the ability for some code to execute other code : we are not talking about user permissions here but code permissions!
  .NET : Full Trust : Unrestricted access
  .NET : Execution : Run code
  User Authentication and access
  Users can log in via a variety of methods determined by the programmer
  OAuth : very popular today (not in this exam!) : connects your website to any other method of authentication such as
  Google 
  Facebook
  Windows Authentication : handled by Windows
  Database Authentication : handled by the programmer
  Anonymous : zero authentication


Hosting
  
  Your web application must be hosted somewhere on a machine that is accessible from where your users have to access it.  Normally this means the internet but it could also mean a local web-based application stored fully on a secure LAN just for internal use only.
  Factors required for web hosting
  Reliability
  Scalability
  Technial Support when required
  Cross-platform support : normally either a Windows or a Linux based web hosting package is used. But support for other clients would be normal, like IOS and Android for example.

What is HTML?

It is a language used to transmit information across the internet from one machine to another
Data is transmitted from one machine (client) to another (server), and vice-versa.
HTML data is split into two parts : the header information which tends to be INVISIBLE then the body information which produces the visible page.
HTML is PLAIN TEXT
HTML can be EDITED WITH ANY TEXT EDITOR
HTML souce code can be VIEWED FOR ANY PAGE (Inspect Element on any web page)


What is the structure of HTML?

HTML uses something called the DOM (Document Object Model) model to produce data which can be viewed (rendered) on a page.  Data is stored on the server in text files called .htm files and then when it is sent to the client, the browser is a program which takes this data and produces output for the viewer to see.

Who's in charge of the development of HTML?

W3C the World Wide Web Consortium is a group of companies and organisations which steer the development of HTML and other web-related standards.

XHTML is a stricter form of HTML which enforces 1) lower case tags 2) all start tags must have a closing tag etc..



Building A Basic Web Page

<tag></tag>

Used to open and close all documents within an HTML page
Every opening <tag> must have a corresponding </tag> closing tag
Some tags are 'self closing' such as <input />
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

<meta>

'meta' data is DATA ABOUT DATA so the <meta> tags will hold information about the web page and some of the data within it
<meta charset="UTF-8">  where UTF is a 2-byte character set used to represent all of the languages in the whole world.  Using it we can represent any character in any language which is quite useful!!!

<title>
Goes within <head>
Note that "title" is an attribute that can be used to generate hover text also eg 
<span title="display this text on hover">Hover Over Me</span> produces Hover Over Me 
<body>
Defines visible part of document

What is the DOM Model?
Document Object Model

It is a clear hierarchy of every object laid out correctly and finding its place on the page, so we can locate every item uniquely  using a simple hierarchy system. 
WINDOW ==> DOCUMENT ==> HTML ==> BODY ==> ELEMENT ==> ATTRIBUTE ==> VALUE
<div>

HTML5 Structure Elements 

Nav
Header
Section
Article
Aside
Footer


HTML5 Semantic Elements


These elements may not actually DO ANYTHING but they convey MEANING to the BROWSER PROGRAM and possibly to the END USER also.
A good example will be <header> or <footer> which don't actually do anything but can be used to clearly mark where the page header and footer go.


List Of HTML5 Semantic Elements Below:


<article>    Defines an article
<aside>    Defines content aside from the page content
<details>    Defines additional details that the user can view or hide
<figcaption>    Defines a caption for a <figure> element
<figure>    Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
<footer>    Defines a footer for a document or section
<header>    Specifies a header for a document or section
<main>    Specifies the main content of a document
<mark>    Defines marked/highlighted text
<nav>    Defines navigation links
<section>    Defines a section in a document
<summary>    Defines a visible heading for a <details> element
<time>    Defines a date/time

    <script>alert('hello')</script>     ALERT STRAIGHT AWAY


Defer

    <script defer    DON'T RUN SCRIPT UNTIL PAGE LOADED



jQuery

    $(document).ready(function(){

      // WRAP ALL JQUERY CODE TO ENSURE IT ONLY RUNS AFTER 
      // FULL HTML PAGE HAS FINISHED LOADING

    });

  
Selecting elements


  give element a 
      ID    ID="X"
      CLASS   class="green"
      
  or select by TAG  


  document.getElementById(x)
  document.getElementsByClassName('green')
  document.getElementsByTagName('h3')

  document.querySelector('#x')                 (all) as well

  $('#x').      ID
  $('.green')   CLASS





Amending Elements


  document.getElementById('x').innerHTML = "<p>HI</p>"

                              .width="200px"

                              .setAttribute("width","200px");
  


Creating Elements


var text_node = document.createTextNode("some text");
var paragraph_node = document.createElement('p');
paragraph_node.appendChild(text_node);
document.body.insertBefore(paragraph_node,document.getElementById('start_point'));





Declaring variables


  var

    Global : all functions

      <script>
        var x=1;      global



    Local : within function

      function y{}{
        var z=2;      LOCAL INSIDE FUNCTION   
      }
    
      // z not visible HERE

  
    MISTAKE :    X=7;    (NO VAR)  ==> NO ERROR

    use scrict;   FIRST LINE OF CODE ==>  forces var declaration

  let 

    within a BLOCK OF CODE EG A FOR LOOP 

    let t = 22;     VALID ONLY IN THE LOCAL CODE BLOCK




  const
    const c = 15;     FIXED


  scope = visibility of element

  

Data types

  CAN REASSIGN A VARIABLE LIVE

    var x = 1;
    var x= "hi";
  
  String
  number
  Boolean     var x=true
  Null      var x=null
  Undefined   var x;
  Date      var d = new Date("25 Sept 2017 08:17")
        var d = new Date()      NOW

      getDate() 22 => 22nd of the month
      getDay()  3 =>  Monday 1   Wed 3    Sunday 7 (or zero)
      getMonth()  zero based counting 0=jan 1=feb dec=11
      
  Object    same as JSON   
    
      {
        a:1,
        b:"hi",
        c: { z:22 }

      }

  Array

      var myArray=[1,2,3];
      myArray.push()    add to end
      myArray.pop()     from end
      
              var z=myArray.pop()  

      myArray.shift()   remove from start
      myArray.unshift() add to start
  

  Declare a variable

        var x;    

          DECLARED BUT "UNDEFINED"

        var x="1",y=1,z=3;

      

  JSON 

    var y = {
      a:1,
      b:"some string"
    }

    y.a
    y.b
    y.b.length
    y.b["length"]


    EXTEND AN OBJECT (ADDING ATTRIBUTES)

    y.newProperty=16;

    y.prototype.newPropertyB = 77;     // ADD NEW CLASS VALUE TO STRUCTURE


Input/Output

  alert('hi')
  confirm('are you sure')     
  prompt('what is your name',"no name")


    
onload() event


  <body onload="dothis()">   CAN BE USED TO RUN A FUNCTION AFTER PAGE LOADS

  OR

  $(document).ready(function(){
      // code 
  });



Validation


Input can be validated eg isNaN() can be used to test if an item is a number or not.




Chapter 9 : SetTimeout, setInterval, xmlHttpRequest, Ajax, localStorage, sessionStorage, appCache, cookies




SetTimeout and SetInterval



setTimeout      SETS A DELAY

  setTimeout(doThis,after_this_delay);


setInterval     REPEAT LIKE A CLOCK


  setInterval(doThisFunction,repeat_function_every_x_milliseconds);




Creating elements eg an image


document.createElement('img');

<time>





HTML5 changed elements


Deprecated means NO LONGER USED (may still work but avoid!)

<font> replaced by CSS styling
<basefont>
<center> replaced by CSS
<strike>
A few elements have CHANGED THEIR MEANING

<b>
WAS : bold
NOW : use CSS for bold effect
<i>           
WAS : italic
NOW : use CSS for bold effect
<u>
WAS : underline
NOW : use CSS for underline effect








Images


Raster Image (with pixels)

Vector Image (scalable)

<img>

<figure>

<figcaption>

<alt>

Used to display alternative text when the image cannot load for some reason





Canvas


<canvas>

Better for complex scenes, real-time mathematical animations, high-performance elements (filters and ray tracers), and video manipulation.
Canvas is better for real time data
Drawn images cannot be modified by scripting and CSS.
Image types are bitmaps and not easily scalable.
Must add an ID to add the element to the HTML DOM
Must specify which application to run when canvas is clicked
<script> has two functions
Firstly : draw interface
Secondly : process click event
Sample Game
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg589521?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396
Test for browser compatibility

try{
    document.createElement(“canvas”).getContext(“2d”); 
    document.getElementById(“support”).innerHTML = “HTML5 Canvas is supported in your browser.”;
}
catch (e) {
    document.getElementById(“support”).innerHTML = “HTML5 Canvas is not supported in your browser.”; 
}


Sample Canvas Application

See lab 2.2 for Sample Canvas Application

Run this code eg at http://www.onlinehtmleditor.net/

function drawDiagonal() {
var canvas = document.getElementById('diagonal'); //creates a css id
var context = canvas.getContext('2d');
// Save a copy of the current drawing state to be restored upon exit
context.save();
// Move the drawing context to the right and down using transformation
context.translate(70, 140);
// Draw the same line as before, but using the origin as a start
context.beginPath();
context.moveTo(0, 0);
context.lineTo(70, -70);
context.stroke();
// Restore the old drawing state
context.restore();
}
window.addEventListener("load", drawDiagonal, true);


<canvas id="diagonal" width="400" height ="400";>
</canvas>





var myCanvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas01');
var ctx = myCanvas.getContext('2d');                //CRITICAL LINE TO CREATE 
                                                    //JAVASCRIPT CODE FOR CANVAS
ctx.fillStyle = "#FF0000"               // ff RED FULL  00 ZERO  00  ZERO    
ctx.fillStyle = "#F00"                 // same as above, shorter
ctx.fillStyle = "red";                

ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(255, 0, 0)";
ctx.fillStyle = "rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)";   // alpha = 0.5 tranparancy







SVG


<svg>

Better for static images and high-fidelity documents for viewing and printing.
Objects are part of the Document Object Model (DOM); they can be modified by scripting and CSS at any time.
Vector graphics are scalable.
Sample Game
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg589521?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396


Canvas VS SVG


https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg193983%28v=VS.85%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396#Using_Canvas_AndOr_SVG




Audio and Video


Codec

Codec is short for ENCODE / DECODE and is used to mean the art of taking a video or audio file, saving it for use as a single file (ENCODING) and then playing it back again on demand (DECODING).  A CODEC is a means of doing this ie different CODECS are used on different platforms to produce the same result ie to play the file
Compression

Is the art of making a file smaller
Data compression uses various techniques to reduce the size of data blocks
Video/audio/image compression may or may not reduce the image quality
Lossy WILL LOSE DATA (FOREVER!) eg BMP => JPG, WMA => MP3, WMV => MP4
Lossless means that ALL THE DATA IS SAVED even though the file takes up less space  EG WMA => M4A
<audio>

Now comes NATIVE IN HTML5!!!
<audio>

audio.currentTime=0;
audio.play();
}


<audio controls="controls">
<source src="BuffaloChickenDip.mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<button title="Play at 15 seconds" onclick="playAt(4.5);" >4.5
Seconds</button>
<button title="Restart Audio" onclick="restart();">Restart</button>







Video

<video>

Now comes NATIVE IN HTML5!!!
src multiple src elements can be used to define the file to be used to play the video.  The browser will use the first valid source file that it can play.
width,height of the video
controls : if present then the play/pause/forward/rewind controls are visible on the screen for the user to use
poster : image to display while the initial video is downloading so the user is not staring at a blank screen but has something to look at 
autoplay : automatically begins playing once the video has buffered (annoying adverts on pages do this also!)
play
pause
preload
seeking
volume
fullscreentoggle
captions/subtitles
track

<video width="320" height="240" controls="controls">
<source src="travelVideo1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
<source src="travelVideo1.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Chapter 3 - HTML Continued - Forms, Input Types, Input Attributes, Placeholder, Required, Pattern, Tables, Definition Lists


Forms
Document Object Model

Input Elements

Text Field (type="text")
Number Field (type="number")
Pattern
Date Field (type="date)
URL (type="url")
Email (type="email")
Password (type="password")
Datalist
Used to provide 'autocomplete' as users find an item within a pre-determined list
<datalist>
<option value="x">
url    For entering a URL. It must start with a valid URI scheme, (for example http://, ftp:// or mailto:).
tel    For entering phone numbers. It does not enforce a particular syntax for validation, so if you want to ensure a particular format, you can use pattern.
email    For entering email addresses. By default it will only take one, but if the multiple attribute is provided, a comma separated list of email addresses is valid.
search    A text input field styled in a way that is consistent with the platform's search field.
number    For numeric input, can be any rational integer or float value.
color    For choosing colors.
range    For number input, but unlike the number input type, the value is less important. It is displayed to the user as a slider control.
datetime    For entering a date and time value where the time zone is provided as GMT.
datetime-local    For entering a date and time value where the time zone provided is the local time zone.
date    For entering a date (only) with no time zone provided.
time    For entering a time (only) with no time zone provided.
week    For entering a date that consists of a week-year number and a week number, but no time zone.
month    For entering a date with a year and a month, but no time zone.


Demo - show form submission and show how the items are appended to the URL on submission


Input Attributes


placeholder


required


pattern = Regex


used to validate the user input against a very specific arrangement of letters, numbers and characters specified inside the pattern /... / string
pattern=“\d{3}-\d{4}” forces ddd-dddd where d stands for any alphabetic character 

let this site teach you (https://regexone.com/)

then move on to more advanced playing around with regular expressions here - http://regexr.com


  \s    whitespace

  \d  number

  \w  word (character)

  ^ starts with

  $ ends with

  a*    means 0 or more instances            aaaa OK

  a+    means 1 or more instances

  a?    means 0 or 1 instance 
  
  [^9]   not 9







autocomplete
 specifies if an element may have autocomplete enabled

autofocus
 this element will get the focus when the page loads

list - refers to <datalist>

max / min eg of number element

maxlength of input element



Validation Of User Form Input



Lab : Create a form and validate different types of input
New Form Elements in HTML5

What do the new form elements (progress, meter, datalist, keygen, and output) add to a web page? 
Progress is a control the shows the status of a task being completed such as a file being uploaded. 
Meter is used for scalar measurement within a known range such as temperature or weight measurement. 
Datalist is used to show a list of options; it is used with the new list attribute for the input element. 
Keygen is a control for key-pair generation. 
The output control displays the result of a calculation; an example would be the sum of the values of two input elements. (NOTE: These are not supported in IE9)


Output Elements


Tables

<table>
<caption>
<thead>
<tbody>
<tfoot>
<tr>
<td>
<col> for styling
<colgroup> for styling
 

Alternative To Table - Definition List

Note : Can be called either Definition List or Description List
<dl> Definition List
<dt> Definition Tag
<dd> Definition Detail

Typography And Fonts


What are fonts?

Fonts are files which are stored on a computer.  When a particular letter is requested to be viewed on the screen it is 'rendered' (displayed) with the help of the font files already present on that computer.

fonts are FILES DOWNLOADED TO YOUR COMPUTER : USED TO DISPLAY

    FILE EXTENSION

      .eot    EMBEDDED OPEN 
      .ttf    TRUE TYPE FONT

  web font

  web-safe font

    FONT GUARANTEED TO WORK IN NEARLY ALL BROWSERS




Discussion Introduction And Demo : Some Example Of Latests Fonts

https://www.myfonts.com/hotnewfonts/

What files are used to create fonts?

Common ones are

EOT Embedded Open Font
TTF True Type Font
OFF Open Font Format
WOFF Web Open Font Format

Support For Fonts

Support for fonts is not universal but differs from operating system to operating system.

EOT : Microsoft only!
TTF : very good - see http://caniuse.com/#feat=ttf
OTF : very good - see http://caniuse.com/#search=otf
WOFF : very good  - see http://caniuse.com/#search=woff
SVG fonts : Apple only - see http://caniuse.com/#feat=svg-fonts


Using A Font On A Web Page

<font> tag is now deprecated.

Fonts are set on a page using CSS font-family declaration eg font-family:arial to include arial font on a page.

Web-safe Fonts

These fonts are included in most operating systems so are counted as safe to use on your web page with the minimum of fuss.

http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_fonts_ref.htm
http://www.cssfontstack.com/

Web Fonts


These fonts have to be installed in order to be used.

They are installed for a web page by downloading the font then including the link to that font on the website using the CSS @font-face command

CSS @font-face {     font-family: FONT-NAME;     src:url('path-to-font-file.eot');   font-weight: normal;   font-style: normal;    }



  @font-face{
    font-family: CustomFontName;
    src:url('http://get_font_from_here');
  }

  <div font-family:CustomFontName>

            www = > font squirrel




Font stacks are used to declare multiple fonts in case the first (preferred) ones are not supported
font-family: Chunkfive, Georgia, Palatino, Times New Roman, serif;
Examples of web fonts
http://www.cssfontstack.com/Web-Fonts

Inline vs Block



Block Elements

Header H1..H6
<div>
<p>


Inline Elements

<span>



Display:block
Display:inline
Display:inline-block - can have a width


Float


float:left
float:right;
clear:both

Clearing a float with the clear: both property


Positioning Elements


position:absolute     (x,y) relative to origin at top left  eg top="100px" left="100px"
Relative
Static    this is the default
Fixed     fixed on page






postion:static
      DON'T USE (THIS IS THE DEFAULT)
      EVERY ITEM TAKES UP SPACE, PAGE FLOW DOWN FROM 
      PREVIOUS ITEM


    !!! REMOVE ITEMS OUT OF NATURAL FLOW OF PAGE CONTENT !!!

:fixed    item does not move as page moves up down : fixed background
      fixed relative to PHYSICAL VIEWPORT WINDOW

:absolute fixed relative to page(0,0) BUT WILL MOVE UP AND DOWN
      WITH PAGE

:relative   DON'T USE AS SAME AS FLOAT:LEFT

See css_20_position.htm





Overflow


Overflow : What to do when content exceeds the size of a box

scroll : scroll bar becomes visible
hidden : extra text is hidden and truncated and unavailable to view by the user
visible : extra text flows outside the box (very messy)

Introduction To CSS Box model


Alignment eg 

http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp and 
http://ss64.com/css/box-align.html




CSS Box Model


Outline : doesn't take up space!
Margin : takes up the space around the element, pushing other elements away from it
Border
Padding : Between the content and the border of the box
Content : Inside the box
Float : Left, Right



Box-sizing : content-box  (default)


.div1{
  width: 200;   // this is for the content only!
  border : 10px
  padding: 10px
}
Total width on screen is 200 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10





Box-sizing : border-box


Width is set by the width variable and the border and padding fit inside this width!

https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_box-sizing

Transformations


2D Transformations
Translate
transform:translate(x,y); will move item along x and y axes by amount given.
Rotation 
transform:rotate(30deg);
Scaling
transform:scale(2,3) will scale twice as large in x direction and treble in size in y direction
Skewing
transform:skew(30deg,30deg) skews the item along x and y axes

Transition


CSS Transitions are between two CSS states

<style>
div {
  width:300px;
  height:200px;
  background-color:green;
  transition-duration:2s;
}

div:hover{
  width:700px;
  transition-duration:2s;
  transition-delay:1s;
}
</style>







Animation using @keyframes


GET START AND END AND TIME
ANIMATION-NAME
ANIMATION-DURATION

animation-name property specifies a name for the @keyframes animation.
animation-duration property defines how many seconds or milliseconds an animation takes to complete one cycle.
Remember to include an animation duration or it will default to 0.
animation-timing-function  specifies the speed curve of the animation.
animation-delay property defines when the animation will start.
animation-iteration-count property defines how many times an animation should be played
animation-direction property defines whether or not the animation should play in reverse on alternate cycles.
animation-play-state property specifies whether the animation is running or paused.
animate command can combine shorthand some commands into one line

AppCache - Application Cache


Note : different to browser cache 
Note : web page must be accessed through web server



APPCACHE : TURN ON 

  1) 

    Create a file called Manifest.appcache

    This is our CACHE MANIFEST file.

    Link to it from every HTML page using 

     <html manifest="MANIFEST.appcache">


  2) 

    The other way is to explicitly list this file inside the manifest cache file 



  2) WEB SERVER
  
      SET MIME FILE-HANDLING TYPE TO
        text/cache-manifest

      MIME ==> USED TO MANAGE DIFFERENT FILE EXTENSIONS
          ON SITE EG OPEN PDF FILE

        .htaccess  OR  IIS 








myManifest.appcache



Select files can be named in a CACHE MANIFEST file which specifies certain files to be stored on the client machine for offline usage.

CACHE MANIFEST file also dictates what files to use if the application goes offline.



https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/appcache/beginner/


AppCache is best used on SPA Single Page Apps because then there is only one cache used.  If you are using an app which adds data in the URL then each different permutation of text will be independently cached, meaning lots of extra data is cached on your machine eg www.mysite.com/a=1&b=2 will have a new cache created for it.

View manifest files at

chrome://appcache-internals/




  SPECIFY OFFLINE BEHAVIOUR


  3 SECTIONS TO FILE

    1. CACHE
      script.js   FILES WHICH SHOULD BE
            CACHED (STORED ON LOCAL 
            DEVICE) TO SPEED UP 
            FUTURE VISITS
    2. NETWORK    
      login.asp   NEVER CACHE THIS AS ALWAYS
            MUST BE ONLINE WHEN LOG IN
    3. FALLBACK
            FILES TO BE DISPLAYED WHEN
            APP GOES OFFLINE
            
          /html/  /offline.html

                                       FOLDER    MESSAGE WHEN OFFLINE


  
Note : deprecated

  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Using_the_application_cache

To be replaced by Service Workers (not covered)

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers















CACHE MANIFEST 
  # in here go files which are explicitly named and will go in the application
  myfile.htm
  mystyle.css
  myscript.js
  Note : can also add another CACHE section later on in the file which does the same thing
NETWORK
  # specifies files which must be accessed online if not in the cache
  * means all files must be accessed online if not explicitly named in the cache
FALLBACK
  # use this to tell the browser what file to use if a network resource is not available
  offline.html will display to the user if the application is offline
  Talk to the appcache by using window.applicationCache javascriopt object
  window.applicationCache.status == UNCACHED/IDLE/CHECKING/DOWNLOADING/UPDATEREADY/OBSOLETE
  applicationCache.update()  
  listen for the UPDATEREADY event then auto-reload page to get new cache contents
MIME type : text/cache-manifest
.appcache file extension
Lab : Slide 1-2 : Is AppCache supported in your browser?
Add this code to determine if the browser also supports the AppCache

var AppCache_support = !!window.applicationCache;

AppCache.update(); // Attempt to update the user's cache....

cache, network, fallback.  
NOT USEFUL IF URL CHANGES (USE IN SPA)
window.applicationCache - true if supported
Appcache.update




















Storage





HTML is a STATELESS PROTOCOL

  it does not have any 'memory' of previous page visits


Persistence = STORING DATA BETWEEN CLICKS





Storing Data Between Clicks - The 'State' Of The Application or Session

Persistence is the ability to store data

Data can be stored on the SERVER and the CLIENT!


HTML

  Stateless protocol : does not have any inherent 'memory' of previous page visits


Look at

  1. Cookies
  2. Session Cookies
  3. Application State
  4. Local Storage







  
Cookies


    SMALL TINY PIECES OF DATA
    
    4kb max

    SENT WITH EVERY PAGE REQUEST 

    DATA ACCESSIBLE BOTH BY CLIENT AND SERVER

      document.cookie = "username=John Doe";

      document.cookie = "username=John Doe; 
            expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC";


      SESSION COOKIE HAS NO EXPIRY DATE; VALID FOR THIS SESSION ONLY

    ((COOKIE/SESSION DATA ==> VALID FOR ONE USER ONLY))

    Example at http://jsfiddle.net/user/philanderson888/fiddles/



  Local Storage


    FOR LARGE FILES WE WANT A WAY OF STORING DATA ON LOCAL CLIENT MACHINE

    5MB PERMANENTLY ON CLIENT

    localStorage.setItem("lastname", "Smith");

    localStorage.lastname

    localStorage.getItem("lastname")



  Session Storage

    
    same as local storage, destroyed after session

    sessionStorage.setItem("lastname", "Smith");


  Browser Cache (temporary internet files)


    Files downloaded eg CSS, Javascript can be stored in client cache for
        later use












Cookies


Cookies are small text files which can be used to transmit data between the client and the server which reflect the state of the session or application.
Small file size (4kb)
Sent with every HTTP request
Can be accessed by both client and server code




Cookies are tiny (4kb max) pieces of text data

They are SENT WITH EVERY HTML REQUEST

create with

document.cookie="username=Phil";

  ((store data as key/value pair))


  IF NO EXPIRY DATE ==> SESSION COOKIE : DELETED WHEN YOU FINISH
    USING THIS SITE

expires="18 Dec 2017";

  THIS COOKIE NOW LAST UNTIL THAT DATE


** not secure, vulnerable to hacking **

CLIENT : STORE MORE DATA










HTML5 localStorage


Local storage is the ability to store files and data permanently on the client machine.  
This is fully persistent ie it has no time span after which the data will expire, 
so in that sense the data is permanent although if the client clears their cache and temporary 
storage areas out which they are more than welcome to do at any stage, the data will be erased.
Can only be accessed by client browser code
Can timestamp and purge items from local storage cache in order to manage space effectively
Lab - Code on PDF : does your browser support local storage???


Up to 5MB max

localStorage.setItem("firstName","phil");
            

Get data (next time)

  localStorage.getItem("firstName");   ==> return "phil"


Shorten this

  localStorage.firstName   ==> return "phil"












HTML5 Session Storage


Same exists just for one session

sessionStorage.setItem..
              .getItem..    same syntax


Note : BROWSER CACHE WILL ALREADY STORE EG IMAGES, GIF, STYLESHEETS, JS, FROM 
  YOUR SITE ANYWAY ***********







Application State


The data pertaining to the application as a whole for all users



Session State


The data pertaining to one user after they log in, relevant for that user for that logged in 'session' until they either log out or they stop using the application in which case after a certain time span the session will automatically log them out and the session data will cease to exist.
Storing Data Permanently On The Client Device

AJAX USING XMLHTTPREQUEST



    request = new XMLHttpRequest();       CREATE REQUEST OBJECT

    request.open('GET',url,true);
      // Get = read data
      // true = asynchronous

    request.onload=function(){
      callback(request.responseText);
    };
    request.send(data);   // Fire off request


   request.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
          document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
          this.responseText;
        }
    };




Book example

function loadJSON(url, data, callback) {
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("GET", url, true);
    xhr.onload = function() {
        callback( JSON.parse(xhr.responseText) );
    }
    xhr.send( JSON.stringify(data) );
}
loadJSON("my.json", { id : 1 }, function(response) {

Image ISMAP


ISMAP is a flag set to TRUE or FALSE inside the <img> tag.  
  <img ismap>  
  If present then this tells the computer that a server-side image map 
  has been created which maps to different parts of the same image, so 
  in order to implement this mapping all that is required is to send the 
  coordinates of the click points to the server as part of the html
  information, in this case as part of the URL information sent.

  Note : relative image coordinates are sent (not absolute page coordinages)

  See W3 Schools ISMAP for working example of this

Usemap is a CLIENT SIDE IMAGE MAP DEFINED HERE

Red item ON TOP

Blue item UNDERNEATH

Way of showing both items in relationship to each other

  SOURCE = FROM TOP (SEE RED ITEM FIRST)

  DESTINATION = FROM BOTTOM (SEE BLUE ITEM PRIORITY)

  IN ==> BOTH ITEMS OVERLAP

  OUT ==> ONLY ONE OR OTHER ITEM, NOT WHERE THEY OVERLAP

  OVER ==> BOTH ITEMS

CSS Regions


Created by ADOBE for Desktop publishing but has not really caught on, in fact Google and many others oppose this being used in browsers because it conflicts with the basic programming authority of separation of code from the display (rendering) of that code - this reverts back to mixing the two.

The idea is to create a 'named flow' of source content (text) which flows into one or more 'regions' for display on a page, such as when a newspaper article is displayed in more than one place.

Even Microsoft does not fully support this product!!!

We have the CONTENT SOURCE TEXT called FLOW-INTO:my-flow where my-flow is the name given to this flow

source=RAW TEXT=named flow=flow-into


We have the CONTENT CONTAINERS, INTO WHICH THE SOURCE TEXT FLOWS, called FLOW-FROM

container=DESTINATION DIVS=flow from
